## 1. Quickstart for contributors and AI agents

Before writing code in this repository, a contributor or AI agent MUST:

1. Read `README.md`.
2. Read `docs/language-reference/fuse-language-reference.md`.
3. Read `docs/implementation-plan.md` and locate the current wave and phase.
4. Read `docs/repository-layout.md`.
5. Read `docs/learning-log.md`, especially recent entries.
6. Read `STUBS.md` and identify every active stub in scope for the current wave.
7. Check the working tree state.

If the task is a wave-completion audit or sign-off review, also read
`docs/audit.md` before evaluating the closure claim.

Before committing, a contributor or AI agent MUST:

1. Run `fuse check` on touched Fuse code when applicable.
2. Run focused tests for affected packages.
3. Run the `Verify:` command for every task being marked done and record the
   actual output.
4. Run broader test suites when the change crosses package boundaries.
5. Verify that the diff contains only intended changes.
6. Ensure any non-trivial bug fix has both a regression and a learning-log entry.
7. Ensure every issue, bug, or obstacle encountered during the work is either
   fixed at the root cause or explicitly rescheduled before the task is
   closed.
8. Append the corresponding `docs/learning-log.md` entry after the fix or
   explicit reschedule lands.
9. Update `STUBS.md` if any stubs were retired or introduced.

Before marking a wave complete, a contributor or AI agent MUST:

1. Confirm that all proof programs for the wave exist in `tests/e2e/` and pass
   in CI.
2. Confirm that `STUBS.md` reflects all retirements and additions from the wave.
3. Append a wave closure entry (`WCxxx`) to the learning log.
4. Confirm CI is green on the full test suite, not just the wave's local tests.

## 2. Language reference precedence

### Rule 2.1 — The reference precedes implementation.

No language feature may be implemented before it appears in
`docs/language-reference/fuse-language-reference.md`.

### Rule 2.2 — The reference is normative.

If the compiler and the reference disagree, the compiler is wrong unless the
reference is explicitly updated first.

### Rule 2.3 — Silence means absence.

If the reference does not specify a feature or behavior, that feature does not
exist.

### Rule 2.4 — Implementation contracts are mandatory.

Any language feature that is architecturally sensitive must include an
implementation contract in the reference. Backend-critical semantics must not
be left to implication.

### Rule 2.5 — Feature sections carry implementation status.

Every feature section in the language reference carries an explicit status tag:

- `SPECIFIED — Wxx`: specified in this document, scheduled for the named wave.
- `DONE — Wxx`: implemented, proof program exists in `tests/e2e/`, CI passes.
- `STUB — emits: "..."`: partially wired but not fully lowered; the compiler
  must emit the named diagnostic when this feature is used.

A section without a status tag is a documentation defect. A section tagged
`DONE` must have a corresponding e2e proof program. A section tagged `STUB`
must have a corresponding entry in `STUBS.md`.

There is no `SPECIFIED — Wave TBD` or `SPECIFIED — Post-V1` status. Every
feature in the language reference is scheduled to a concrete wave in
`docs/implementation-plan.md`. If a feature does not fit any scheduled wave,
the plan must be revised to add a wave, not the feature deferred.

### Rule 2.6 — A feature retires in one wave.

A user-visible feature may have prerequisite substrate in earlier waves, but it
has exactly one retirement wave: the wave whose exit criteria declare it done,
whose `STUBS.md` row is removed, and whose proof program demonstrates the full
behavior. Parsing in one wave, typing in another, lowering in a third, and the
real behavior in a later wave is forbidden when those steps together are the
feature the user experiences. Earlier waves may land infrastructure only if the
feature remains tagged `STUB` in the language reference and remains active in
`STUBS.md`.

If a feature is too large to fit honestly in one wave, the plan must either
enlarge the wave or split the feature into smaller user-visible features with
separate language-reference sections, separate `STUBS.md` rows, and separate
proof programs. By the time the Go-based Stage 1 compiler is declared
feature-complete, every language and stdlib feature must already exist end to
end. Later waves may change the implementation path (self-hosting, native
backend, performance, targets, documentation), but they are not valid
retirement waves for unfinished language or stdlib semantics. (See learning-log
L015, L018, L021, L022.)

## 3. Compiler architecture invariants

### Rule 3.1 — There are exactly three IRs.

The compiler architecture is `AST -> HIR -> MIR`. No pass may skip across an IR
boundary.

### Rule 3.2 — IR types are disjoint.

`ast.*`, `hir.*`, and `mir.*` are separate type families. They must not be
interchangeable.

### Rule 3.3 — HIR metadata is not optional.

HIR nodes must be built through builders or constructors that establish all
required metadata fields.

### Rule 3.4 — Every pass declares reads and writes.

Passes are registered in a manifest that declares which metadata they consume
and which metadata they produce.

### Rule 3.5 — Invariant walkers run at pass boundaries.

Invariant walkers must run in debug and CI contexts. A failing invariant is a
bug in the producing pass, not a reason to disable the walker.

### Rule 3.6 — Deterministic collections only in IR.

Builtin map iteration must not determine user-visible IR ordering or backend
emission order.

### Rule 3.7 — The TypeTable is global and canonical.

Types are interned and referenced by `TypeId`. Alternate type-identity systems
are forbidden.

### Rule 3.8 — Liveness is computed once.

Liveness is computed once per function and then consumed by later passes. It
must not be recomputed opportunistically downstream.

### Rule 3.9 — Unresolved types must not cross into codegen.

If a type is unresolved after checking and lowering, the compiler must emit a
diagnostic and stop. Silent fallback to `Unknown` or `int` is forbidden.

### Rule 3.10 — Backend contracts are architecture, not cleanup.

Pointer-category separation, total unit erasure, monomorphization completeness,
and structural divergence are design constraints, not codegen conveniences.

## 4. Bug policy

### Rule 4.1 — Fix root causes.

A bug fix must remove the structural cause, not merely quiet the visible
symptom.

### Rule 4.2 — No workarounds.

Code that exists only because some other code is wrong is forbidden.

### Rule 4.3 — Every meaningful bug gets a regression.

If the bug took real diagnosis effort or revealed a real invariant, the fix
must land with a regression test.

### Rule 4.4 — Every meaningful bug gets a learning-log entry.

If the bug taught the team something about the design, it belongs in the log.

### Rule 4.5 — Bootstrap tests use the real Stage 2 source.

Self-hosting verification must compile the real `stage2/` compiler, not only
toy inputs.

### Rule 4.6 — Every task DoD must include a verification command.

A DoD written in prose alone is incomplete. Each task in the implementation
plan must carry a `Verify:` line naming the exact command that proves the DoD
is met when run on a clean working tree. If no such command can be written, the
task is not ready to be executed. Prose-only DoDs are a planning defect, not an
acceptable shorthand.

### Rule 4.7 — Issues are fixed, then logged.

If work surfaces an issue, bug, or obstacle that materially affects the code,
the plan, or the specification, it must be fixed at the root cause or
explicitly rescheduled before the task or wave is closed. Once that resolution
or reschedule is real, the contributor must append the corresponding entry to
`docs/learning-log.md`.

Silent carry-forward is forbidden. A known issue that is merely remembered,
worked around, or mentioned in chat but not fixed or logged is still a live
project defect.

## 5. Stdlib policy

### Rule 5.1 — Stdlib is the compiler's semantic stress test.

If stdlib fails, assume the compiler is wrong before assuming stdlib is wrong.

### Rule 5.2 — Stdlib bodies must be checked.

Skipping stdlib body checking is forbidden.

### Rule 5.3 — Core is OS-free.

`stdlib/core/` must not depend on hosted APIs.

### Rule 5.4 — Full depends on core; ext depends on full or core.

Dependency direction is one-way.

### Rule 5.5 — No hidden special cases in public stdlib APIs.

If a behavior belongs to a trait or language rule, it must not be quietly
hardcoded in stdlib public API behavior.

### Rule 5.6 — Public stdlib API requires documentation.

Missing docs on public stdlib APIs are a correctness issue for project quality.

## 6. Testing rules

### Rule 6.1 — Tests are deterministic.

Tests must not depend on ambient randomness, wall clock, or machine-local state.

### Rule 6.2 — Golden tests are explicit.

Golden updates require an intentional workflow. Goldens must be byte-stable.

### Rule 6.3 — Test names state the invariant.

A test name should explain what property it protects.

### Rule 6.4 — Property tests must be reproducible.

Property tests require stable seeds and reproducible failures.

### Rule 6.5 — Integration tests should hit the real backend when possible.

A test that claims the compiler emits working binaries should invoke the
backend toolchain and execute the result.

### Rule 6.6 — Stdlib is part of validation, not a separate concern.

Wave exit criteria must include stdlib validation once the relevant surface is
in scope.

### Rule 6.7 — Bootstrap health is release-blocking.

Any regression in self-hosting or reproducibility is a release blocker.

### Rule 6.8 — No feature is complete without an end-to-end proof program.

A feature is complete only when a Fuse program that uses it compiles, links,
runs, and produces the correct output. Unit tests prove a component works in
isolation. End-to-end proof programs prove the compiler works for the user.
Both are required. (See learning-log L013, L014.)

### Rule 6.9 — Stubs must emit diagnostics, not silent defaults.

If a feature is parsed and type-checked but not lowered or codegenned, the
compiler must emit a diagnostic such as `"closures are not yet implemented"`.
A stub that compiles silently is indistinguishable from a working
implementation to both the test suite and the user. Silent stubs are
forbidden. (See learning-log L013.)

### Rule 6.10 — Exit criteria must be behavioral, not only structural.

Wave exit criteria must include at least one behavioral requirement: "this
program compiles, runs, and returns exit code N." Structural criteria ("HIR
nodes carry metadata", "MIR terminates correctly") are necessary but never
sufficient on their own. (See learning-log L014.)

### Rule 6.11 — Proof programs are committed artifacts, not agent-run checks.

A proof program is not verified by the agent running it locally and reporting
success. It is verified by committing the `.fuse` source and its expected
output to `tests/e2e/` and confirming CI passes on that file. A wave is not
complete until CI is green on the proof program suite for that wave. An agent
that claims a proof program passes without a CI-green commit is making an
unverifiable assertion.

### Rule 6.12 — Every wave begins with a stub audit.

The first phase of every wave is a stub audit: a written enumeration of every
stub in scope for that wave, naming the file, line, current behavior, emitted
diagnostic, and the task that retires it. This audit must be committed to
`STUBS.md` before any other task in the wave begins. A wave that proceeds past
Phase 00 without a committed stub audit is in violation regardless of
subsequent work quality.

### Rule 6.13 — Wave completion requires a `STUBS.md` update.

`STUBS.md` at the project root is a normative document listing every current
stub. A wave is not complete unless every stub it was scheduled to retire has
been struck from the table and every new stub it introduced has been added with
a diagnostic and a retiring wave. A wave that leaves `STUBS.md` unchanged when
it should change it is incomplete by definition.

### Rule 6.14 — Wave completion requires a wave closure learning-log entry.

Before a wave is marked complete, a wave closure entry (format: `WCxxx`) must
be appended to the learning log. The entry names the proof programs added, the
stubs retired, any stubs introduced, what was harder than planned, and what the
next wave must know. An agent that cannot fill this entry honestly has not
completed the wave.

### Rule 6.15 — Overdue stubs block wave entry.

Phase 00 of every wave must inspect `STUBS.md` for overdue rows. A stub is
overdue when its `Retiring wave` column names a wave strictly less than the
current wave and the stub has not yet been retired. Stubs whose retiring wave
equals the current wave are not overdue at Phase 00 — the current wave is, by
definition, the wave scheduled to retire them, and the retirement work lands
during the wave (`PCL`, per Rule 6.16). If any overdue stub exists, the wave
cannot begin until every overdue stub is either retired or the plan is
explicitly revised to reschedule it, with the reschedule reason recorded in the
stub history log (Rule 6.16).

An agent that begins a wave while overdue stubs remain is in violation
regardless of the wave's eventual outcome. "I'll clean those up at the end" is
not acceptable — overdue stubs have already proved that deferred cleanup does
not happen.

### Rule 6.16 — `STUBS.md` carries an append-only stub history log.

`STUBS.md` contains two sections:

1. **Active stubs** — the current table of live stubs (Rule 6.13).
2. **Stub history** — an append-only log, organized by wave, of every stub
   creation, retirement, or reschedule event during the project's life.

Every wave closure must append a section to the history log naming the stubs it
added, the stubs it retired (with the proof program or test that confirmed
retirement), and any stubs it rescheduled (with the reason). The history log
is never edited in place. A stub that appears and disappears from the active
table without a corresponding history entry is a violation.

The stub history log is the project's audit trail for stub lifecycle: any
reader can answer "when was this stub introduced?", "when was it retired?",
and "what evidence confirmed its retirement?" from the log alone.

### Rule 6.17 — Every diagnostic carries primary span, explanation, and suggestion.

Every compiler diagnostic must include:

1. A **primary span** pointing at the most specific source location the user
   can act on — not a whole file, not a whole function when a single token is
   the problem.
2. A **one-line explanation** written so the user understands what went wrong
   without reading the rule cross-reference. Reference text appended after the
   explanation is allowed.
3. A **suggestion** where one is possible — the concrete alternative the user
   most likely meant, phrased as an action. Not every diagnostic can offer a
   suggestion; those that can, must.

Diagnostic quality is a first-class correctness concern, not a polish phase.
Every wave that introduces new diagnostics must include a review step that
confirms each new diagnostic meets this rule. A diagnostic that renders
("the text appears") but fails the rule is a quality defect, not a working
diagnostic.

This rule is the project's forcing function against the failure mode where a
compiler technically emits errors but users cannot act on them without guessing
or reading the source. Rust's developer experience lead is 80% diagnostic
quality; Fuse will not ship less.

## 7. Determinism rules

### Rule 7.1 — Same input, same bytes.

Identical source, compiler version, and target must produce byte-equivalent
outputs according to project reproducibility rules.

### Rule 7.2 — Symbol mangling is stable.

Mangled names depend only on semantic identity, not iteration order or
timestamps.

### Rule 7.3 — No ambient randomness in output-affecting paths.

If unique names are needed, deterministic counters are allowed; random numbers
are not.

### Rule 7.4 — No timestamps or absolute paths in goldens.

Reviewable artifacts must be stable across machines and days.

## 8. External dependency rules

### Rule 8.1 — Zero external Go dependencies.

The Stage 1 compiler must not depend on external Go modules.

### Rule 8.2 — Runtime dependencies are explicit.

Bootstrap dependencies on Go and C are explicit and temporary. Hidden toolchain
dependencies are forbidden.

### Rule 8.3 — No host-language leakage into Fuse artifacts.

Stage 1 implementation details must not become part of compiled Fuse program
semantics.

## 9. Commit and PR rules

### Rule 9.1 — One logical change per commit.

Avoid mixed commits that combine unrelated feature, refactor, and formatting
work.

### Rule 9.2 — Commit messages use stable areas.

Commit subjects use the form `<area>: <subject>`.

Valid areas include:

- `compiler/<package>`
- `runtime`
- `stdlib/core`
- `stdlib/full`
- `stdlib/ext`
- `cli`
- `tests`
- `docs`
- `ci`
- `tools`

### Rule 9.3 — Branches reference plan IDs when possible.

Task-scoped work should name the wave or task ID in the branch name.

### Rule 9.4 — Force-pushing shared protected branches is forbidden.

### Rule 9.5 — Wave phases land in distinct commits.

Every wave's Phase 00 stub audit, implementation, and Phase `PCL` wave closure
must land as separate git commits, even when the same contributor does all
three in one session. The phase model (`docs/implementation/phase-model.md` §3)
treats these as distinct temporal phases; the commit history must reflect that
separation so that:

- the `P00` audit is independently verifiable at the closure-SHA predecessor,
- implementation work is reviewable without being mixed with governance
  updates, and
- the `PCL` commit is a clean retirement record whose diff is only stub
  removal, Stub-history append, `WCxxx` append, and
  `.claude/current-wave.json` update.

The minimum commit sequence per wave is:

1. **P00 commit** — updates `.claude/current-wave.json` to
   `{current_wave: Wxx, current_phase: P00, updated: YYYY-MM-DD}`,
   refreshes any stale `STUBS.md` Active-row descriptions,
   and records the output of `go run tools/checkstubs/main.go -wave Wxx
   -phase P00`. Touches no compiler source.
2. **Implementation commit(s)** — one or more commits carrying the
   compiler source, tests, and any proof programs. Multiple per-phase
   commits are encouraged when the wave has independent sub-features.
   No `STUBS.md` Active-row removal, no `WCxxx` entry, no
   `current-wave.json` phase bump happens here.
3. **PCL commit** — removes the retired row from the `STUBS.md` Active
   table, appends the wave's Stub-history block, appends the `WCxxx`
   entry to `docs/learning-log.md`, and bumps
   `.claude/current-wave.json` to
   `{current_wave: Wxx, current_phase: PCL, updated: YYYY-MM-DD}`.

Waves `W00`–`W06` pre-date this rule and were landed as single combined
commits; the retrospective record is in `L020`. Rule 9.5 applies to `W07`
and every subsequent wave.

## 10. Learning log rules

### Rule 10.1 — The learning log is append-only.

Do not rewrite old entries. Supersede them with new ones.

### Rule 10.2 — The format is enforced.

Each bug entry (`LNNN`) must include: reproducer, what was tried first, root
cause, spec gap, plan gap, fix, cascading effects, architectural lesson, and
verification.

Each wave closure entry (`WCxxx`) must include: proof programs added, stubs
retired, stubs introduced, what was harder than planned, what the next wave
must know, and verification commands.

### Rule 10.3 — The learning log feeds the guide and plan.

If a bug exposed a specification or planning hole, the corresponding document
must be updated.

### Rule 10.4 — Wave closure entries are required before wave sign-off.

A wave is not eligible for sign-off until its `WCxxx` entry exists in the log.
This entry is the evidence that the wave was completed deliberately, not by
assertion.

### Rule 10.5 — Issue, bug, and obstacle entries are appended after the fix.

If a task or wave encounters an issue, bug, or obstacle that materially changes
the implementation, plan, or specification, the contributor must first fix it
or explicitly reschedule it, then append the learning-log entry that records
the reproducer, root cause, fix, and lesson. The learning log is not optional
cleanup; it is part of the fix.

## 11. Multi-machine workflow

### Rule 11.1 — Commit before changing machines.

Uncommitted work across machines causes silent drift and duplicated debugging.

### Rule 11.2 — Re-validate after context switches.

When resuming work after a machine or session switch, re-read the relevant
docs, plan section, recent learning-log entries, and the current state of
`STUBS.md`.

## 12. Safety and `unsafe`

### Rule 12.1 — Unsafe remains explicit.

Unsafe operations must remain visible at the use site.

### Rule 12.2 — Unsafe bridge files are enumerated by name.

New unsafe bridge files require explicit documentation updates.

### Rule 12.3 — Public safe APIs must not smuggle unsafe behavior.

If a safe wrapper exists, its safety story must be defensible and documented.

## 13. Permanent prohibitions

The following are permanently forbidden unless the foundational docs change
explicitly.

- implementing undocumented language features
- bypassing stdlib body checking
- introducing workarounds in stdlib for compiler bugs
- recomputing liveness in backend passes
- letting unresolved types reach codegen
- depending on nondeterministic IR ordering
- introducing external Go dependencies into Stage 1
- treating bootstrap C11 details as permanent language semantics
- marking a task done without running its `Verify:` command
- marking a wave done without CI-passing proof programs in `tests/e2e/`
- marking a wave done without a `WCxxx` learning-log entry
- leaving `STUBS.md` stale at wave boundaries
- beginning a wave while any prior wave's stubs are overdue
- retiring a stub without a corresponding stub history log entry

## 14. AI agent behavior

An AI agent working on this repository MUST:

- read the foundational docs before making architectural changes
- read `STUBS.md` at the start of every session to know the current stub state
- prefer root-cause fixes over local patches
- avoid destructive actions on unrelated user work
- update tests and the learning log when required
- treat the language reference and implementation plan as the source of truth
- preserve the bootstrap model until the plan explicitly retires it

An AI agent working on this repository MUST also, for every task:

- state the specific file and line number of every change before marking the
  task done
- run the task's `Verify:` command and include the actual command output as
  evidence before claiming the DoD is met
- never report a `Verify:` command as passing without having actually run it

An AI agent working on this repository MUST also, at wave boundaries:

- not mark a wave complete unless all proof programs for that wave pass in CI
- update `STUBS.md` to reflect all retirements and introductions from the wave
- append a `WCxxx` wave closure entry to the learning log before declaring the
  wave done
- treat a failing `Verify:` command as a bug in the implementation, not as a
  reason to revise the `Verify:` command to pass

An AI agent working on this repository MUST NOT:

- assert that a test passes without running it
- assert that a proof program produces the correct output without committing it
  and observing CI
- close a wave whose `STUBS.md` entries have not been updated
- close a wave without a `WCxxx` learning-log entry
- interpret "the code looks correct" as equivalent to "the Verify command
  passes"
