# Wave Completion Audit Checklist

> Status: reference for the staged Fuse docs. This document is a plain-language
> companion to [rules.md](rules.md) Section 6 and the
> [learning log](learning-log.md) entries L001-L015 and WC000+. The normative
> rules are in those files; this checklist is the practical walkthrough an
> auditor uses to confirm that a wave-completion claim is real.

## Who this is for

You are an auditing agent (or human reviewer) who has been asked to confirm
that Wave `Wxx` is truly complete. You did not write the wave and you did not
write the exit criteria. Your job is to be the outside check that Fuse's
predecessors never had - the reason six critical features (pattern matching,
monomorphization, `?`, drop codegen, closures, channels) were silently broken
at the self-hosting gate in the previous attempt ([L013](learning-log.md)).

You should assume the implementer:

- may have satisfied every exit criterion as literally written while missing
  the spirit,
- may have unit tests that pass but no program that actually runs,
- may have marked stubs as retired in `STUBS.md` without deleting the stub
  behavior from the code,
- may have written a `WCxxx` closure entry that sounds plausible but glosses
  over real gaps.

Your job is not to be polite. Your job is to find the gap before Wave `Wxx+1`
begins.

## Before you start

Read, in this order:

1. The wave's per-wave plan: `docs/implementation/waveXX_<topic>.md`
2. The overall plan at [docs/implementation-plan.md](implementation-plan.md)
3. The current state of `STUBS.md`
4. The `WCxxx` closure entry the implementer added to
   [docs/learning-log.md](learning-log.md)
5. `.claude/current-wave.json` - should name `Wxx` and phase `PCL` at the
   moment you audit

Then re-read the "Exit criteria" and "Proof of completion" sections of
`waveXX_<topic>.md`. Every checklist section below refers back to specific
Rules in [rules.md](rules.md) and specific `Lxxx` entries - if you want to
understand why a check exists, follow that link.

## Checklist A - Governance and structural hygiene

These are the non-negotiable shape checks. If any of them fail, stop and
report; no later section matters until these are clean.

- [ ] **A1. Stub audit was committed before implementation began.**
      The wave's first phase is always `P00 Stub Audit`. There should be a
      commit touching `STUBS.md` dated before any implementation commits in
      this wave. (Rule 6.12.)
- [ ] **A2. The `STUBS.md` Active table matches reality.**
      Every row the wave was scheduled to retire is gone from the Active
      table. Every new stub the wave introduced is in the Active table with a
      diagnostic and a concrete retiring wave of the form `Wxx`.
      (Rules 6.13, 2.5.)
- [ ] **A3. The `STUBS.md` Stub history has a new append-only block for
      `Wxx`.**
      The block lists Added/Retired/Rescheduled. No prior block was edited in
      place. (Rule 6.16.) Run
      `go run tools/checkstubs/main.go -history-current-wave Wxx`.
- [ ] **A4. No stub is overdue.**
      Run `go run tools/checkstubs/main.go -wave Wxx -phase P00`.
      A stub is overdue if its retiring wave < the current wave and it is
      still in the Active table. A stub whose retiring wave equals the current
      wave is not overdue at P00; the wave's PCL retires it. (Rule 6.15.)
- [ ] **A5. A `WCxxx` entry exists in `docs/learning-log.md`.**
      It has all five required fields: proof programs added, stubs retired,
      stubs introduced, what was harder than planned, what the next wave must
      know. "What was harder than planned" is not blank - it says "nothing"
      explicitly or lists real friction. (Rule 6.14.)
- [ ] **A6. `.claude/current-wave.json` is consistent.**
      Its `current_wave` is `Wxx`, `current_phase` is `PCL`, and `updated` is
      a recent date. Run `go run tools/checkgov/main.go -current-wave`.
- [ ] **A7. The full CI suite is green on the closure SHA.**
      Not just the local tests, not just "it passed on my machine." Look at CI
      on the commit that the closure claim points to. (Rule 6.11.)

## Checklist B - Behavioral proof (the L013 trap)

This is the section that existed to catch the failure mode from
[L013](learning-log.md): a wave where every structural exit criterion passes,
every unit test passes, but no program using the feature has ever run
end-to-end.

**From W05 onward**, every user-visible feature introduced in `Wxx` must have
at least one proof program in `tests/e2e/`.

- [ ] **B1. The wave's exit criteria include a behavioral requirement.**
      Open `waveXX_<topic>.md` and find the Exit criteria section. At least
      one bullet must be of the form "a program that uses `<feature>`
      compiles, runs, and exits N" - not just "HIR nodes carry metadata" or
      "MIR blocks terminate structurally." (Rule 6.10, L014.)
- [ ] **B2. A proof program exists in `tests/e2e/` for every user-visible
      feature this wave added.**
      Open `tests/e2e/README.md` and confirm each new program is registered
      with its expected output. The `WCxxx` entry's "Proof programs added this
      wave" list should match what is in the directory.
- [ ] **B3. The proof programs actually exercise the feature.**
      Read each `.fuse` source. Would the program still produce the expected
      output if the feature were reverted to a stub? If yes, the proof program
      is not adversarial - it is a ceremonial check
      ([L013](learning-log.md)). Flag it.
- [ ] **B4. The proof programs are green in CI on the closure SHA.**
      Not "the agent ran them locally." CI, on the committed SHA.
      (Rule 6.11.)
- [ ] **B5. No proof program leans on `Unknown` types.**
      If the AST-to-HIR bridge or the type checker is silently defaulting
      unknown types to a usable shape (for example, everything becomes C
      `int`), integer-only programs will pass while the real feature is
      broken. This is the specific secondary failure mode in
      [L013](learning-log.md). Spot-check by grepping the checker for
      `Unknown` fallback branches.

## Checklist C - Silent-stub traps (prior-attempt specific)

Prior attempts reached the self-hosting gate while six features were silent
stubs. For each feature, you are specifically checking that the code path was
implemented rather than skipped. Only apply the sub-checks relevant to the
current wave's scope.

- [ ] **C1. Pattern matching ([L007](learning-log.md)).**
      If `Wxx` is W10 or later: does `match` with >= 2 arms produce distinct
      codegen paths? Are HIR patterns structured nodes (`LiteralPat`,
      `BindPat`, `ConstructorPat`, `WildcardPat`), not a `PatternDesc string`?
      Is the MIR a cascading branch chain on the discriminant? Red flag:
      lowerer emits `TermGoto(armBlock)` unconditionally.
- [ ] **C2. Monomorphization ([L008](learning-log.md),
      [L015](learning-log.md)).**
      If `Wxx` is W08 or later: does `compiler/monomorph/` run in the driver
      pipeline between checking and HIR lowering? Does it collect concrete
      instantiations, duplicate bodies with substitution, and rewrite call
      sites to specialized names? Red flag: monomorph package exists with
      `Record`/`Substitute` but is not called from the driver.
- [ ] **C3. Error propagation (`?` operator, [L009](learning-log.md)).**
      If `Wxx` is W11 or later: does `?` on a `Result[T, E]` lower to a branch
      that inspects the discriminant and early-returns on `Err`? Red flag:
      lowerer returns `lowerExpr(n.Expr)` (pass-through) or checker returns
      `Unknown` for the `?` expression type.
- [ ] **C4. Drop codegen ([L010](learning-log.md)).**
      If `Wxx` is W09 or later: does generated C for a type with a `Drop`
      impl emit an actual `TypeName_drop(&_lN);` call? Red flag: generated C
      contains `/* drop _lN */` comments where a function call should be.
- [ ] **C5. Closures ([L011](learning-log.md)).**
      If `Wxx` is W12 or later: does a closure `|x| { x + 1 }` lower to a
      lifted function plus an environment struct? Red flag: lowerer returns
      `constUnit()` for closure expressions, or liveness skips closure bodies
      entirely.
- [ ] **C6. Channels and `spawn` ([L012](learning-log.md)).**
      If `Wxx` is W07 or later: does `spawn f(x)` lower to a runtime
      thread-creation call, not a synchronous function call? Does the type
      table have a channel type kind? Red flag: lowerer emits
      `EmitCall(dest, arg, nil, Unit, false)` for `SpawnExpr`.

## Checklist D - Architectural invariants (L001-L006)

These are the carried-forward architecture rules from earlier attempts. They
apply to every wave that touches the relevant subsystem.

- [ ] **D1. Lexical ambiguities are explicit contracts, not intuition
      ([L001](learning-log.md)).**
      If the wave touches the lexer or parser: raw strings, `?.`, and
      struct-literal disambiguation are decided by written rules in the
      language reference, and the golden corpus includes adversarial cases -
      not just representative examples.
- [ ] **D2. Stdlib bodies are checked, not just signatures
      ([L002](learning-log.md)).**
      If any stdlib module reaches lowering in this wave, the checker ran on
      its bodies. Red flag: stdlib signatures used but bodies skipped "for
      speed" - `Unknown` types propagate to codegen as C `int`.
- [ ] **D3. Monomorphization rejects partial specializations
      ([L003](learning-log.md)).**
      If the wave produces a specialized function, all function-level and
      impl-level type parameters are concretely substituted. "Some inference
      succeeded" is not enough. A specialization with any remaining type
      variable is a defect.
- [ ] **D4. Pointer categories are distinct ([L004](learning-log.md)).**
      If the wave touches codegen: borrow-derived pointers and `Ptr[T]` values
      are not handled by the same logic. Call-site adaptation and field-access
      lowering both respect the distinction.
- [ ] **D5. Unit erasure is total, not opportunistic
      ([L005](learning-log.md)).**
      If the wave touches ABI or backend: once a `Unit` payload is erased at
      one location, it is erased at every location participating in the same
      concrete ABI. Constructors, patterns, function pointers, and aggregate
      layouts all agree.
- [ ] **D6. Divergence is structural, not simulated
      ([L006](learning-log.md)).**
      If the wave touches MIR or codegen: post-panic and post-`return` paths
      do not invent fallback values to satisfy type expectations. Divergent
      blocks terminate; nothing reads from them.

## Checklist E - Cross-cutting features (the L015 trap)

- [ ] **E1. Cross-cutting features are not folded into one phase of another
      wave.**
      If the wave introduces a feature that touches parsing, resolution,
      checking, lowering, and codegen, it should be its own wave with multiple
      phases - not a single phase inside somebody else's wave.
      ([L015](learning-log.md) - generics was the canonical failure.)
- [ ] **E2. Each integration point has its own proof program.**
      For cross-cutting features, a single end-to-end test is not enough; the
      plan should require a proof program at each pipeline seam (for example,
      checker, monomorph, lowerer, codegen).
- [ ] **E3. Exit criteria name pipeline integration explicitly.**
      "The feature works in isolation" is never sufficient for a cross-cutting
      feature. The exit criteria must say the feature is reachable from the
      driver end-to-end.

## Checklist F - Diagnostics quality

- [ ] **F1. Every new diagnostic has a primary span, a one-line explanation,
      and a suggestion where applicable.**
      (Rule 6.17.) If the wave added parse or check errors, pick a few at
      random and confirm they meet all three requirements.
- [ ] **F2. Every active stub emits its declared diagnostic.**
      Pick two or three rows from the `STUBS.md` Active table that are in
      scope for this wave's packages. Write a minimal `.fuse` program that
      would trigger each stub. Confirm the compiler emits the exact diagnostic
      text declared in the table. (Rule 6.9.)

## Checklist G - Workarounds and shortcuts

- [ ] **G1. No workarounds were introduced.**
      Grep the diff for `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`, "for now",
      "temporary", and "revisit." Each one that remains must have a concrete
      retiring wave recorded in `STUBS.md` - or it is a Rule 4.2 violation.
- [ ] **G2. No silent defaults were added.**
      Grep the diff for `Unknown` fallbacks in the checker, `Unit` returns in
      the lowerer for new expression kinds, and `/* ... */` placeholder
      comments in codegen. Each is a potential silent stub.
      (Rule 6.9, L013.)
- [ ] **G3. Verify commands are portable.**
      Every new `Verify:` command in the wave's plan runs on Linux, macOS, and
      Windows. No bash-specific forms, no hardcoded `/tmp/...` paths, no
      process substitution. (Rule 6 quickstart.)

## Red flags - stop and escalate

If you see any of these, stop the audit and write them up; they are strong
signals that the wave is not actually complete, regardless of what the exit
criteria say:

- The `WCxxx` entry's "What was harder than planned" is blank or one vague
  sentence. Real waves always surface friction.
- Proof programs exist but only exercise integer arithmetic or single-arm
  `match`. The feature under test is never adversarially pressed.
- Unit tests in the wave's packages are all green, but the project-owned
      proof-program runner is not part of CI for the feature being signed off.
- Stubs were struck from the Active table without appearing in the Stub
  history's Retired list with a proof program reference.
- The closure commit and the implementation commits are the same commit.
  Closure should be a separate, auditable commit after the implementer has
  already convinced themselves the work is done.
- The implementer and the auditor are the same agent in the same session.
  ([L013](learning-log.md) is the direct warning about closed-loop
  self-verification.)

## Writing up your audit

Produce a short report with:

1. **Wave:** `Wxx` - `<topic>`
2. **Closure SHA:** the commit the implementer named as the closure commit.
3. **Checklist results:** one line per section (A-G) - pass, fail, or N/A,
   with a one-sentence reason.
4. **Red flags hit:** list every red flag triggered, with a pointer to the
   file or commit that triggered it.
5. **Verdict:** complete / incomplete / needs-rework.
6. **If incomplete:** the smallest concrete thing the implementer must do to
   re-qualify for audit.

The audit report itself should be committed alongside the wave's closure
artifacts - future auditors need to see what their predecessor saw and
decided.
