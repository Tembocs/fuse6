# Implementation Tree

> Status: canonical implementation planning tree for the staged Fuse docs.

This directory stages the future `docs/implementation/` tree for Fuse.
It owns delivery sequencing, wave closure, proof expectations, and
feature-to-wave ownership. It is not a second language reference; it is the
execution plan that retires the language reference honestly.

## Planning contract

- no user-visible feature spans waves
- every wave names entry state, phases, expected deliveries, proof commands,
  and closure artifacts
- every wave must advance at least one of Fuse's three pillars without
  regressing another pillar
- every stdlib module named in the language reference has explicit wave and
  phase ownership in this tree

## The three pillars

Fuse is planned and implemented against three first-class constraints:

- memory safety without a garbage collector
- concurrency safety without a Rust-style borrow-checker learning cliff
- developer experience as a first-class constraint

The implementation plan must preserve all three. A wave may emphasize one
pillar more heavily than the others, but it may not quietly trade one pillar
away to make another easier.

## Entry points

- [../implementation-plan.md](../implementation-plan.md) — canonical
  implementation-plan entry point for the meta tree
- [phase-model.md](phase-model.md) — required phase, task, verification, and
  closure model used by every wave document
- [../repository-layout.md](../repository-layout.md) — repository structure
  contract for file placement, top-level directories, and docs ownership
- [../registry-protocol.md](../registry-protocol.md) — frozen Wave 23 package
  registry contract
- [../audit.md](../audit.md) — wave-completion audit checklist used during
  closure review and sign-off

The per-wave documents in this directory are the detailed delivery contracts for
W00 through W30.

## Stdlib ownership in the meta plan

The expanded staged language reference now names the baseline standard
library explicitly. The implementation tree therefore assigns ownership by wave
rather than leaving modules implied by broad labels.

| Wave | Scope | Owned public surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| W20 | core foundations | `core.bool`, `core.comparable`, `core.debuggable`, `core.equatable`, `core.float`, `core.float32`, `core.fmt`, `core.hash`, `core.hashable`, `core.int`, `core.int32`, `core.int8`, `core.list`, `core.map`, `core.math`, `core.option`, `core.printable`, `core.result`, `core.set`, `core.string`, `core.traits`, `core.uint32`, `core.uint64`, `core.uint8` |
| W21 | allocatorization of core | allocator trait, system/global allocator policy, allocator-parameterized heap-owning core containers |
| W22 | hosted and application baseline | `full.io`, `full.fs`, `full.os`, `full.env`, `full.path`, `full.process`, `full.sys`, `full.random`, `full.simd`, `full.time`, `full.timer`, `full.thread`, `full.sync`, `full.shared`, `full.chan`, `full.net`, `full.http`, `full.http_server`, `full.json`, `full.yaml`, `full.toml`, `full.json_schema`, `full.uri`, `full.regex`, `full.crypto`, `full.jsonrpc`, `full.argparse`, `full.log`, `full.test` |
| W23 | package acquisition | manifests, lockfiles, resolver, fetcher, registry protocol |
| W30 | ecosystem documentation | tutorials, guides, published documentation site, migration and ecosystem material |

## Reference pairing

The implementation tree stays in lockstep with the staged language reference.
Wave docs should cite the relevant guides under [../language-reference/](../language-reference/),
especially the per-module `core/` and `full/` guides that define the stdlib
surface W20-W22 are expected to retire.
