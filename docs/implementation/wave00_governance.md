# Wave 00: Governance and Phase Model

> Part of the [Fuse implementation plan](../implementation-plan.md).


Goal: establish the repository, module, build, test, tooling, documentation,
and governance foundations required for disciplined compiler work. Seed
`STUBS.md` with the initial stub inventory covering every unimplemented
language feature.

Entry criterion: none.

State on entry: only the foundational docs and the `STUBS.md` seed
exist. No Go module. No CI. No compiler packages.

Exit criteria:

- `make all` succeeds from a clean checkout
- `go test ./...` succeeds on the initial package set
- CI runs on every push and PR for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- the foundational docs exist and are readable
- `STUBS.md` exists with a seeded Active stubs table covering every
  user-visible language feature not yet implemented, and an empty Stub
  history section
- `.claude/current-wave.json` names the active wave for coordination

Proof of completion:

```
make all
go test ./...
go run tools/checkstubs/main.go
```

## Phase 00: Stub Audit [W00-P00-STUB-AUDIT]

- Task 01: Initialize STUBS.md with seed stubs [W00-P00-T01-INIT-STUBS]
  Currently: file does not exist.
  DoD: STUBS.md exists with the Active stubs table seeded with every
  language feature scheduled for a wave greater than W00, each with its
  scheduled retiring wave. Stub history section is empty.
  Verify: `go run tools/checkstubs/main.go -audit-seed`

  [W00-P04-T01-CURRENT-WAVE-FILE]
  Verify: `go run tools/checkgov/main.go -current-wave`
- Task 02: Document phase model [W00-P04-T02-PHASE-MODEL-DOC]
