# Wave 06: Type Checking

> Part of the [Fuse implementation plan](../implementation-plan.md).


Goal: build a checker that fully types user code and stdlib bodies without
leaving unknown metadata for later passes. This wave covers every
type-system feature whose semantics live in the checker: primitive types,
structs (including newtype `struct T(U);` form), enums (including unions
as distinct declaration form), traits (with coherence), generics (with
parameter scoping), associated types, casts, visibility, function pointer
types, `impl Trait` parameter-position, variadic extern signatures,
`@repr`/`@align` annotations on types.

Pillar alignment:

- Memory safety: the checker must reject invalid ownership-relevant and
  layout-relevant type constructions before they reach lowering or codegen.
- Concurrency safety: the type system foundations required by later
  concurrency rules must be explicit and precise rather than inferred by later
  passes.
- Developer experience: type errors, trait failures, and stdlib-checking
  failures must surface at the checker boundary with concrete diagnostics rather
  than leaking into later compiler stages.

Entry criterion: W05 done. Phase 00 confirms no overdue stubs.

State on entry: `compiler/check/` is an empty stub.

Exit criteria:

- no checked HIR node retains `Unknown` metadata
- two-pass checker (signatures first, then bodies)
- stdlib bodies checked in the same pass as user modules (L002 defense)
- trait-bound lookup through supertraits (reference §12.7)
- coherence and orphan rules enforced (reference §12.7)
- associated types resolve (reference §30.1)
- `as` cast semantics enforced (reference §28.1)
- numeric widening enforced (reference §5.8)
- function pointer types (reference §29.1)
- union declarations checked (reference §49.1)
- newtype pattern (single-field tuple struct form) checked
- opaque return `-> impl Trait` single-concrete-type-per-function rule
  (reference §56.1)
- `@repr(C)` / `@repr(packed)` / `@repr(Uxx|Ixx)` / `@align(N)` validated
  (reference §37.5)
- variadic extern signatures checked
- four visibility levels enforced on every use site

  Verify: `go test ./compiler/check/... -run TestContextualInference -v`
- Task 02: Zero-arg generic calls [W06-P05-T02-ZERO-ARG]

  Currently: function pointer types are specified but not yet isolated as their
  own completion boundary.
  Expected deliveries: first-class `fn(A, B) -> R` type checking.
  DoD: `fn(A, B) -> R` is a first-class type. Nominal identity is by
  signature.

## Phase 07: `impl Trait` Parameter and Return Positions [W06-P07-IMPL-TRAIT]

- Task 01: `impl Trait` parameter-position [W06-P07-T01-IMPL-TRAIT-PARAM]
  Currently: parameter-position `impl Trait` is at risk of drifting into generic
  lowering work if it is not retired in the checker.
  Expected deliveries: checker desugaring and validation for parameter-position
  `impl Trait`.
  DoD: `fn f(x: impl Trait)` desugars to `fn f[T: Trait](x: T)` at check

  function pointer work.
  Expected deliveries: checker-side single-concrete-type enforcement for return
  `impl Trait`.
  DoD: checker records a single concrete return type per `impl Trait`
  return signature; multi-type paths are a diagnostic.
  Verify: `go test ./compiler/check/... -run TestImplTraitReturn -v`

## Phase 08: Unions, Newtypes, and Layout Annotations [W06-P08-LAYOUT-FORMS]

  Currently: unions remain an unchecked declaration form on entry.
  Expected deliveries: checker validation for union declarations.
  DoD: `union U { a: T1, b: T2 }` checks field types; union fields may not
  implement `Drop`.
  Verify: `go test ./compiler/check/... -run TestUnionCheck -v`
- Task 02: Newtype pattern [W06-P08-T02-NEWTYPE]
  Currently: newtype checking can still drift into later lowering work if not
  retired as a type-system contract here.
  Expected deliveries: checker validation for single-field tuple-struct
  newtypes.
  DoD: `struct U(T);` is distinct from `T`; methods can be attached.
  Verify: `go test ./compiler/check/... -run TestNewtypePattern -v`

  Currently: layout annotations remain only specified at entry.
  Expected deliveries: checker validation for repr/align annotations.
  DoD: `@repr(C)`, `@repr(packed)`, `@repr(Uxx|Ixx)`, `@align(N)` validated
  against target type; conflicting annotations produce diagnostics.

  Currently: variadic extern signatures remain unchecked at entry.
  Expected deliveries: checker validation for variadic extern declarations and
  rejection of variadic Fuse functions.
  DoD: `extern fn printf(fmt: Ptr[U8], ...) -> I32;` checks; variadic Fuse
  functions are a diagnostic.
  Verify: `go test ./compiler/check/... -run TestVariadicExternCheck -v`

## Phase 10: Stdlib Body Checking and Checker Regression Matrix [W06-P10-STDLIB]

- Task 01: No stdlib body skips [W06-P10-T01-NO-SKIPS]

  Verify: `go test ./compiler/check/... -run TestStdlibBodyChecking -v`
- Task 02: Checker regression corpus [W06-P10-T02-REGRESSIONS]

  surface retired by W06.
  Verify: `go test ./compiler/check/... -v`

## Phase 11: Checker E2E Proof [W06-P11-PROOF]

  success.
  Expected deliveries: end-to-end checker proof program.
  Verify: `go test ./tests/e2e/... -run TestCheckerBasicProof -v`

## Wave Closure Phase [W06-PCL-WAVE-CLOSURE]
