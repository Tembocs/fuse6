# Fuse Implementation Plan

> Status: canonical implementation plan for the staged Fuse docs tree.
>
> This document is the build plan from an empty repository to a self-hosting
> Fuse compiler and the later retirement of bootstrap-only implementation
> languages.

## Overview

Fuse is implemented in stages.

- Stage 1 compiler: Go
- Runtime during bootstrap: C
- Stage 2 compiler: Fuse

The bootstrap stack is fixed. Go and C are allowed during bootstrap because
the project must reach a self-hosted Fuse compiler as quickly and safely as
possible. After Stage 2 compiles itself reliably and a native backend is
stable, Go and C are retired from the compiler implementation path.

The C11 backend is therefore bootstrap infrastructure, not the terminal
backend. Design decisions in HIR, MIR, type identity, ownership analysis, and
pass structure must not depend on C11 in a way that would block the later
native backend.

## Language philosophy and three pillars

Fuse is not planned as a generic "systems language" project. The plan is bound
to the language philosophy stated in the project overview:

- memory safety without a garbage collector
- concurrency safety without a Rust-style borrow-checker learning cliff
- developer experience as a first-class constraint

The wave schedule must preserve all three at the same time. A wave may focus on
one pillar more strongly than the others, but it may not create hidden debt by
weakening the other two. In practice this means:

- ownership, destruction, and allocator work must remain explicit and
  verifiable
- concurrency surfaces must preserve `Send`/`Sync`, ranking, and observable
  runtime behavior rather than deferring them into "later cleanup"
- diagnostics, docs, CLI shape, package tooling, and the stdlib surface are not
  polish work; they are part of the language promise

## Working principles

1. Correctness precedes velocity.
2. Structural fixes beat symptom fixes.
3. No workarounds are allowed in compiler, runtime, or stdlib.
4. Stdlib is the compiler's semantic stress test.
5. Every wave has explicit entry and exit criteria.
6. Every task must be small enough to review and verify directly.
7. Every wave that introduces user-visible behavior owns an end-to-end proof
   program, starting from Wave 05 when the minimal end-to-end spine exists.
8. Features that historically were silently stubbed — monomorphization,
   pattern matching, error propagation, closures, concurrency — each have a
   dedicated wave and their own proof program. No such feature is a phase
   inside somebody else's wave.
9. Every feature in the language reference is scheduled to a concrete wave
   (Rule 2.5). No `Wave TBD`, no "post-v1".
10. Before self-hosting begins, a dedicated Stub Clearance Gate wave
  (W24) confirms there are no overdue stubs (Rule 6.15) and no silent
  stubs (Rule 6.9). W24 is a policy checkpoint, not a demand that the
  Active stubs table be literally empty while later waves still own
  explicit tracker rows.
11. Developer experience is a first-class promise. Language Server (W19),
    incremental compile (W04+W18), source-level debugging (W17+W26),
    package management (W23), and user-facing documentation (W30) each
    have dedicated schedule entries. The project does not ship with DX
    gaps it cannot defend.
12. Speed is measured, not assumed. The performance corpus (W17-P13) is
    populated during bootstrap and gated by a dedicated Performance Gate
    wave (W27) before Go and C are retired. Thresholds are enforced in
    CI against named reference implementations.
13. Every user-facing compiler diagnostic carries a primary span, a
    one-line explanation, and a suggestion where one is possible
    (Rule 6.17). Diagnostic quality is a correctness concern, not polish.
14. Stage 1 completeness includes a practical stdlib floor. A Stage 1
  compiler is not complete if it only has core types and thin hosted
  wrappers. The baseline standard library must explicitly schedule the
  everyday facilities Fuse intends to claim as stdlib, including
  structured-data and application/networking surfaces such as JSON,
  YAML, and HTTP client/server if they are part of the promise. Those
  features must land before self-hosting rather than being implicitly
  deferred to `stdlib/ext`.
15. Every wave must state which of the three pillars it advances and what
    concrete deliverables prove that alignment.
16. Every public stdlib module named in the language reference belongs to
    exactly one pre-self-hosting wave and at least one named phase inside
    that wave.
17. Phase names must expose the public surface or semantic contract being
    delivered. Umbrella phases that hide unscheduled modules are invalid.
18. The implementation tree and the language-reference tree move together.
    When the reference adds or splits a user-visible feature, the owning
    wave and phase are updated in the same planning change.

The current expected bootstrap stdlib inventory is broader than the existing
W20/W22 shorthand. At minimum, the plan is expected to account for:

- core and data foundations: `bool`, `comparable`, `debuggable`, `equatable`,
  `float`, `float32`, `fmt`, `hash`, `hashable`, `int`, `int32`, `int8`,
  `list`, `map`, `math`, `option`, `printable`, `result`, `set`, `string`,
  `traits`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `uint8`
- hosted runtime and systems modules: `chan`, `env`, `http`, `io`, `json`,
  `net`, `os`, `path`, `process`, `random`, `shared`, `simd`, `sys`, `time`,
  `timer`
- utility and protocol libraries: `argparse`, `crypto`, `http_server`,
  `json_schema`, `jsonrpc`, `log`, `regex`, `test`, `toml`, `uri`, `yaml`

## Baseline stdlib wave ownership

The staged Fuse language reference names the baseline standard library
explicitly. The implementation plan therefore assigns wave ownership explicitly
rather than leaving modules implied by broad labels.

| Wave | Scope | Owned public surface | Delivery contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| W20 | core foundations | `core.bool`, `core.comparable`, `core.debuggable`, `core.equatable`, `core.float`, `core.float32`, `core.fmt`, `core.hash`, `core.hashable`, `core.int`, `core.int32`, `core.int8`, `core.list`, `core.map`, `core.math`, `core.option`, `core.printable`, `core.result`, `core.set`, `core.string`, `core.traits`, `core.uint32`, `core.uint64`, `core.uint8` | stable public module tree, docs, regressions, and proof coverage |
| W21 | allocatorization of core | allocator trait, system/global allocator policy, allocator-parameterized heap-owning core containers | every core heap path routes through the explicit allocator contract |
| W22 | hosted and application baseline | `full.io`, `full.fs`, `full.os`, `full.env`, `full.path`, `full.process`, `full.sys`, `full.random`, `full.simd`, `full.time`, `full.timer`, `full.thread`, `full.sync`, `full.shared`, `full.chan`, `full.net`, `full.http`, `full.http_server`, `full.json`, `full.yaml`, `full.toml`, `full.json_schema`, `full.uri`, `full.regex`, `full.crypto`, `full.jsonrpc`, `full.argparse`, `full.log`, `full.test` | stable public module tree, application-facing proofs, and no deferred baseline modules |
| W23 | package acquisition | manifest, lockfile, resolver, fetcher, registry protocol | Stage 1 baseline libraries can be consumed and versioned as packages |
| W30 | ecosystem documentation | tutorials, book, migration guides, published docs site | the shipped language and stdlib surface is discoverable without reading implementation code |

## Naming conventions

The plan uses globally unique identifiers.

- Wave headings:
  `Wave 06: Type Checking`
- Phase headings:
  `Phase 03: Trait Resolution and Bound Dispatch [W06-P03-TRAIT-RESOLUTION]`
- Task headings:
  `Task 01: Register All Function Types Before Body Checking [W06-P01-T01-FN-TYPE-REGISTRATION]`

All wave, phase, and task numbers are zero-padded.

## Task format

Every task in this plan must be written with:

- a short goal
- a `Currently:` line naming what exists at the start of the task (file:line
  if the code exists, or "not yet started" if the package is empty)
- an `Expected deliveries:` line naming the public behavior, modules, files,
  or proofs the task must leave behind
- an exact definition of done
- a `Verify:` line giving the specific command that proves the DoD is met;
  this command must fail if the task has not been completed and must be run
  before the task is marked done
- required regression coverage
- clear scope boundaries

```
Task 01: ... [Wxx-Pyy-Tzz-...]
Currently: ...
Expected deliveries: ...
DoD: verifiable completion rule.
Verify: go test ./compiler/pkg/... -run TestName -v
```

A Verify command is not satisfied by "it looks correct" or "unit tests pass".
It is satisfied by running the named command and observing the declared
passing output. The agent or contributor executing the task must record the
actual output of the Verify command before marking the task done.

`Verify:` commands must be runnable on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Unix-only
shell forms (process substitution, `/tmp/...` hardcoded paths, bash-specific
features) are forbidden in normative verification steps. Use Go tests,
project-owned scripts under `tools/`, or explicit per-platform wrappers
instead.

## Wave format

Every wave contains:

- **Goal**: one paragraph summary
- **Pillar alignment**: which of the three pillars the wave advances and what
  it must not regress
- **Entry criterion**: what must be true before this wave begins
- **State on entry**: what the codebase actually looks like when the wave
  begins (which packages are empty, which are stubs, which are partial)
- **Exit criteria**: behavioral and structural requirements that must all be
  true
- **Proof of completion**: the specific commands that, when all passing,
  prove the wave is done; these are run in CI and locally before sign-off
- **Phase 00: Stub Audit**: first phase of every wave; committed to STUBS.md
  before other phases begin. This phase must verify no prior wave's stubs
  are overdue (Rule 6.15).
- One or more implementation phases (P01, P02, ...)
- **Wave Closure Phase (PCL)**: last phase of every wave; produces the WCxxx
  learning-log entry, updates STUBS.md with the wave's stub history block
  (Rule 6.16), and confirms the Active stubs table is current.

Every feature documented in [language-reference/fuse-language-reference.md](language-reference/fuse-language-reference.md) is scheduled
to one or more of the waves above. No feature is deferred to a later
version.

Baseline stdlib facilities expected from a usable Stage 1 compiler must also
be scheduled before self-hosting. If Fuse treats JSON, YAML, HTTP client,
HTTP server, or similar libraries as part of the standard offering, they do
not belong in unscheduled limbo or in `stdlib/ext` by default.


## Per-wave plans

Full detail for each wave — goal, entry criterion, state on entry, exit criteria, proof of completion, implementation phases, and wave closure phase — lives in [implementation/](implementation/). One file per wave.

Supporting planning documents for the meta tree:

- [implementation/README.md](implementation/README.md) — implementation-tree index and stdlib ownership summary
- [implementation/phase-model.md](implementation/phase-model.md) — required phase, task, verification, and closure model
- [repository-layout.md](repository-layout.md) — repository structure contract the wave docs must preserve
- [registry-protocol.md](registry-protocol.md) — frozen Wave 23 package-registry specification
- [audit.md](audit.md) — practical wave-completion audit checklist for closure reviews

Wave documents are expected to stay aligned with the staged language reference,
especially the `language-reference/core/` and `language-reference/full/`
module guides.

## Cross-cutting constraints

The following rules apply to every wave.

- Determinism is a release-level requirement (Rule 7.1).
- No unresolved types may reach codegen (Rule 3.9).
- No pass may recompute liveness independently (Rule 3.8).
- Invariant walkers remain enabled in debug and CI (Rule 3.5).
- Stdlib failures are compiler signals, not library excuses (Rule 5.1).
- Workarounds are forbidden (Rule 4.2).
- Each non-trivial bug produces both a regression and a learning-log entry
  (Rules 4.3, 4.4).
- Every wave that introduces user-visible behavior includes at least one
  end-to-end proof program that fails if the feature is stubbed (Rule 6.8).
- Exit criteria include behavioral requirements, not only structural ones
  (Rule 6.10).
- Every task has `Currently:`, DoD, and `Verify:`. Verify commands must be
  portable across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Stubs emit diagnostics, not silent defaults (Rule 6.9).
- Every wave begins with a Phase 00 Stub Audit (Rule 6.12) and ends with a
  Wave Closure Phase (Rule 6.14).
- STUBS.md is updated at every wave boundary (Rule 6.13) with Active stubs
  table and Stub history append (Rule 6.16).
- Overdue stubs block wave entry (Rule 6.15).
- Every feature in the language reference is scheduled to a concrete wave
  (Rule 2.5). No `Wave TBD`, no "post-v1".
- `tests/e2e/README.md` is updated whenever a proof program is added.
- `tests/perf/README.md` is updated whenever a benchmark is added;
  threshold changes are justified in commit messages (Rule 6.17 also
  applies to perf regressions masked as routine).
- Every compiler diagnostic carries a primary span, a one-line
  explanation, and a suggestion where applicable (Rule 6.17).
- W24 Stub Clearance Gate, W25 Stage 2, and W26 Native Backend all
  require the Rule 6.15 Phase 00 stub audit at entry; they do not use
  literal Active-table emptiness as the gate while future-wave rows
  remain legitimately scheduled.
- W27 Performance Gate must pass before W28 retires the bootstrap
  language surface.
