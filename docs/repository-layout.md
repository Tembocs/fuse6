This layout makes the bootstrap boundary explicit.

- `compiler/` contains the Stage 1 Go compiler.
- `runtime/` contains the bootstrap runtime implemented in C.
- `stage2/` contains the Fuse compiler implemented in Fuse.

When Stage 2 becomes self-hosting and Go and C are retired from the compiler
implementation path, this layout may evolve, but only through an explicit
change to this document and the implementation plan.

## 2. Root-level files

### `STUBS.md`

`STUBS.md` is a normative root-level file that tracks every active stub in the
codebase and an append-only history of stub lifecycle events. A stub is any
compiler feature that parses and may type-check but is not fully lowered,
codegenned, or otherwise operational. Every stub must have an entry in the
Active stubs table; every entry must correspond to a real stub in the code.

`STUBS.md` has two sections. Both are required.

Before the compiler, runtime, and tool trees exist, `STUBS.md` may begin in an
explicit pre-bootstrap seed state that says the Active stubs table is empty
because no code-backed stubs exist yet. Wave 00 replaces that pre-bootstrap
seed with the first code-backed inventory before any post-W00 implementation
wave begins.

### Section 1 — Active stubs

A table of every currently live stub:

```markdown
## Active stubs

| Stub | File:Line | Current behavior | Diagnostic emitted | Retiring wave |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Closure lowering | compiler/lower/lower.go:214 | returns constUnit() | "closures are not yet implemented" | W12 |
| ? operator | compiler/lower/lower.go:389 | returns lowerExpr(n.Expr) | "error propagation not yet implemented" | W11 |
```

### Section 2 — Stub history

An append-only log of stub creation, retirement, and reschedule events,
organized by wave. Each wave closure appends a block in this form:

```markdown
## Stub history

### W05 — Minimal End-to-End Spine

Added:
- Closure lowering (compiler/lower/lower.go:214) — emits "closures are not
  yet implemented" — retires W12
- ? operator (compiler/lower/lower.go:389) — emits "error propagation not
  yet implemented" — retires W11

Retired: (none this wave)

Rescheduled: (none this wave)

### W11 — Error Propagation

Added: (none this wave)

Retired:
- ? operator (compiler/lower/lower.go:389 — now fully lowered) —
  confirmed by tests/e2e/error_propagation.fuse (exits 43)

Rescheduled: (none this wave)
```

The history section is never edited in place. Entries are appended at wave
closure and never retroactively modified.

### Rules for `STUBS.md`

- Every stub must emit the diagnostic listed in the table (Rule 6.9). If the
  code does not emit this diagnostic, the entry is wrong and must be corrected.
- Every stub must name a concrete retiring wave at creation. `TBD` and vague
  labels are forbidden.
- A wave is not complete until it removes every stub it was scheduled to retire
  and updates this file accordingly (Rule 6.13).
- A wave that introduces new stubs must add them to the Active stubs table
  with a diagnostic and a retiring wave before the wave is marked complete,
  and must record the creation in the stub history log (Rule 6.16).
- Phase 00 of every wave must check for overdue stubs and block wave entry if
  any are found (Rule 6.15).
- CI must verify that every stub in the Active stubs table emits its declared
  diagnostic when the corresponding language feature is used. A stub with a
  wrong diagnostic is a CI failure.
- When the Active stubs table is empty, `STUBS.md` must say so explicitly. An
  empty table is a meaningful state that means the compiler has no silently
  broken features.

`STUBS.md` is populated starting from Wave 00. At that point the entire
compiler is unimplemented, so the initial entries may cover all language
features at a coarse granularity, to be refined as waves progress. The stub
history starts empty and accumulates across waves.

### `.claude/current-wave.json`

`.claude/current-wave.json` is the coordination file for the active wave and
phase. It is required once Wave 00 governance work begins and is updated at the
P00 and PCL boundaries of every wave.

The file uses this shape:

```json
{
  "current_wave": "W00",
  "current_phase": "P00",
  "updated": "2026-04-19"
}
```

`current_wave` and `current_phase` must reflect the committed wave state. The
`updated` field records the last deliberate change to the coordination file.

### `go.mod`

Declares the Go module used by the Stage 1 compiler. During bootstrap the Go
module is required and remains source-controlled.

### `go.sum`

Present for Go tooling compatibility. The project policy is zero external Go
dependencies, so this file should remain empty or near-empty unless the policy
changes explicitly.

### `Makefile`

The top-level entry point for local builds. At minimum it must expose:

- `all`
- `stage1`
- `runtime`
- `test`
- `clean`
- `fmt`
- `docs`
- `repro`

### `README.md`

Short project entry point for new readers. It stays brief and points to the
core documents under `docs/`.

### `.gitignore`

Excludes generated artifacts, build output, and editor-local noise. A tracked
source file must never depend on `.gitignore` to disappear from review.

There must be no additional root-level documentation files that duplicate the
role of the core docs. The project uses `docs/` as the normative documentation
surface. The exception is `STUBS.md`, which is normative infrastructure, not
ordinary documentation.

## 3. `cmd/`

`cmd/` contains Go `main` packages during bootstrap.

### `cmd/fuse/`

This is the Stage 1 CLI entry point. It is intentionally thin and owns:

- command-line parsing
- subcommand dispatch
- process exit codes
- stdout and stderr policy
- signal-handling or process-level wiring if required

Business logic does not live in `cmd/fuse/`. Compiler functionality belongs in
`compiler/`.

If a second command-line tool is added later, it must appear as its own
subdirectory under `cmd/`.

## 4. `compiler/`

`compiler/` contains the Stage 1 Go compiler packages. Each subdirectory is a
Go package with one narrow responsibility.

The intended dependency direction is:

```text
diagnostics < typetable < ast < lex < parse < resolve < hir < check < liveness
                         < lower < mir < codegen < cc < driver
                                                                < fmt
                                                                < doc
                                                                < repl
                                                                < testrunner
monomorph spans the semantic and lowering boundary.
```

### `compiler/diagnostics/`

Owns spans, severities, diagnostics, and rendering. Every other package reports
human-facing errors through this package.

### `compiler/typetable/`

Owns interned type identity via `TypeId`. Equality of types is integer
comparison over interned entries, not structural re-walks.

### `compiler/ast/`

Owns the syntax-only AST. AST nodes do not contain resolved symbols, inferred
types, liveness, or backend metadata.

### `compiler/lex/`

Owns lexical analysis.

### `compiler/parse/`

Owns parsing from tokens to AST.

### `compiler/resolve/`

Owns module discovery, symbol indexing, scopes, import resolution, and HIR
construction inputs.

### `compiler/hir/`

Owns the semantically rich HIR and HIR builders. HIR nodes carry metadata
fields used by later passes.

### `compiler/check/`

Owns semantic analysis and type checking. This pass must type-check both user
and stdlib bodies.

### `compiler/liveness/`

Owns the single liveness computation.

### `compiler/lower/`

Owns HIR-to-MIR lowering and the preservation of semantic contracts into MIR.

### `compiler/mir/`

Owns the explicit mid-level IR used by backends.

### `compiler/monomorph/`

Owns generic specialization collection and specialization identity.

### `compiler/codegen/`

Owns the bootstrap backend. During bootstrap this is the C11 emitter.

### `compiler/cc/`

Owns C compiler detection, invocation, and backend-toolchain interaction.

### `compiler/driver/`

Owns the end-to-end orchestration of the Stage 1 compiler pipeline.

### `compiler/fmt/`

Owns formatting support.

### `compiler/doc/`

Owns documentation extraction and rendering.

### `compiler/repl/`

Owns the REPL surface if the project retains one.

### `compiler/testrunner/`

Owns compiler-driven test execution workflows beyond ordinary Go tests.

No additional compiler package may be created casually. A new package must have
one clear responsibility and a defined dependency place in the overall graph.

## 5. `runtime/`

`runtime/` contains the bootstrap runtime implemented in C.

### `runtime/include/`

Contains the runtime header that defines the exported bootstrap ABI.

### `runtime/src/`

Contains the implementation of the runtime entry points. The runtime must
remain small, explicit, and reviewable. High-level behavior belongs in Fuse
stdlib, not in the C runtime.

### `runtime/platform/`

Contains platform-specific shims when unavoidable.

### `runtime/tests/`

Contains runtime-specific tests.

The runtime is bootstrap infrastructure. It exists to expose a minimal and
stable surface, not to become a shadow standard library.

## 6. `stdlib/`

`stdlib/` contains the Fuse standard library and is divided into three tiers.

During bootstrap, the expected stdlib inventory is broader and more concrete
than a minimal directory summary suggests. At minimum, the baseline stdlib
expected for a complete Stage 1 compiler includes:

- core and data foundations: `bool`, `comparable`, `debuggable`, `equatable`,
  `float`, `float32`, `fmt`, `hash`, `hashable`, `int`, `int32`, `int8`,
  `list`, `map`, `math`, `option`, `printable`, `result`, `set`, `string`,
  `traits`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `uint8`
- hosted runtime and systems modules: `chan`, `env`, `http`, `io`, `json`,
  `net`, `os`, `path`, `process`, `random`, `shared`, `simd`, `sys`, `time`,
  `timer`
- utility and protocol libraries: `argparse`, `crypto`, `http_server`,
  `json_schema`, `jsonrpc`, `log`, `regex`, `test`, `toml`, `uri`, `yaml`

The tier split below describes where such modules belong architecturally; it
must not be used to shrink the baseline by silently pushing expected Stage 1
libraries into an undefined future.

### `stdlib/core/`

The OS-free core tier. It must not depend on hosted functionality.

Expected content includes:

- primitive types and aliases
- core traits
- strings
- collections
- iterators
- formatting
- hash support
- runtime bridge files

### `stdlib/full/`

The hosted standard library tier. It may depend on `core/` and exposes the
baseline non-optional stdlib surface promised for a complete Stage 1 compiler:

- IO
- filesystem
- process and environment
- time
- threading
- synchronization
- channels
- structured data / serialization (for example JSON and YAML when promised)
- application/network services (for example HTTP client/server when promised)

### `stdlib/ext/`

Optional extended libraries. This tier may depend on `core/` or `full/` but
not the reverse. Libraries that Fuse treats as part of the baseline usable
standard library must not be hidden here merely because they were forgotten in
Stage 1 planning.

The dependency rule is strict:

`ext -> full -> core`

Reverse dependencies are forbidden.

## 7. `stage2/`

`stage2/` contains the self-hosted Fuse compiler source.

### `stage2/src/`

Contains the Fuse implementation of the compiler. The package structure should
closely mirror the Stage 1 architecture where practical.

### `stage2/tests/`

Contains stage2-specific validation inputs.

### `stage2/build/`

Contains generated build artifacts and is not part of the normative source
tree.

`stage2/` is not a toy example directory. It is the primary long-term target of
the project.

## 8. `tests/`

The top-level `tests/` tree holds shared and end-to-end test assets.

### `tests/e2e/`

End-to-end build and execution tests. This directory is not optional
infrastructure — it is the primary evidence that the compiler works (Rule 6.8).

Every compiler feature that affects program behavior must have at least one
end-to-end proof program here. A proof program is a `.fuse` source file (or a
Go test case containing inline Fuse source) that compiles, links, runs, and
produces a verified output. Proof programs must fail if the feature they
exercise is stubbed or reverted.

The `tests/e2e/` directory must be populated from Wave 01 onward, not deferred
to later waves.

**`tests/e2e/README.md`** is a required normative file. It lists every proof
program currently in the directory, the wave that introduced it, the language
feature it exercises, and its expected output (exit code or stdout). This file
is updated as part of wave completion and is never allowed to drift from the
actual contents of the directory.

The format of each entry in `tests/e2e/README.md` is:

```markdown
| Program | Introduced | Feature | Expected output |
|---|---|---|---|
| hello_exit.fuse | W05-P05 | minimal end-to-end spine | exit code 0 |
| identity_generic.fuse | W08-P06 | generic functions | exit code 42 |
| match_enum_dispatch.fuse | W10-P04 | enum match dispatch | exit code 2 |
| error_propagation.fuse | W11-P03 | error propagation with `?` | exit code 43 |
```

A wave is not complete until its proof programs are listed in this file and CI
passes on all of them (Rule 6.11).

### `tests/bootstrap/`

Self-hosting and reproducibility tests.

### `tests/perf/`

Performance benchmarks with wall-clock and codegen-quality assertions.
Populated from W17 (bootstrap C11 baseline) onward and gated by W27
(Performance Gate). Each benchmark carries an explicit threshold; a regression
past the threshold fails CI on the same footing as a broken test.

**`tests/perf/README.md`** is a required normative file. It lists every
benchmark, the wave that introduced it, the workload it exercises, and the
current target (wall-clock ceiling, or a ratio against a named reference
implementation). The format mirrors `tests/e2e/README.md`. Regressions that are
accepted deliberately update the target with a commit-message rationale; silent
baseline drift is forbidden.

### `tests/property/`

Property-based tests, especially around IR transformations and semantic
preservation.

### `tests/stdlib/`

Integration tests for stdlib behavior that does not belong to a single package
test alone. This tree is especially important once W20-W22 land and the
language promise depends on real library behavior rather than only type shape.

Pass-local tests still belong next to the packages they exercise. The top-level
`tests/` tree is for cross-package and end-to-end assets, not as a dumping
ground.

## 9. `examples/`

Contains example Fuse programs intended to compile with ordinary project
workflows. Examples demonstrate language and library usage and serve as light
integration checks.

Examples should remain small and buildable.

## 10. `tools/`

Contains project tooling that supports the repo but is not part of the compiled
compiler pipeline.

Expected tools include:

- `checkartifacts/`
- `checkci/`
- `checkdocs/`
- `checkgoc/`
- `checkgov/`
- `checklayout/`
- `checkref/`
- `checkruntime/`
- `checkstubs/` — verifies that every entry in `STUBS.md` corresponds to a
  real stub that emits the declared diagnostic; run in CI
- `checktargets/`
- `docsite/`
- `docexamples/`
- `goldens/`
- `perfreport/`

Tooling belongs here when it supports repository workflow, verification, or
documentation, not when it is compiler logic in disguise.

## 11. `docs/`

`docs/` contains the normative documents for the project.

Required files:

- `implementation-plan.md`
- `repository-layout.md`
- `rules.md`
- `learning-log.md`
- `registry-protocol.md`

Supporting reference files:

- `audit.md` - practical wave-completion audit checklist that complements the
  rules, implementation plan, and learning log during sign-off

Required subdirectories:

- `language-reference/` — the canonical language-reference tree. The entry
  point is `language-reference/fuse-language-reference.md`; the `core/` and
  `full/` subtrees elaborate the standard-library surface named by the
  reference.
- `implementation/` — per-wave plan files (one file per wave,
  `wave00_governance.md` through `wave30_ecosystem_documentation.md`).
  `implementation-plan.md` is the index for this directory: it holds the
  overview, working principles, naming conventions, task format, wave format,
  waves-at-a-glance table (with links), per-wave plan index, and cross-cutting
  constraints. The detail of each wave — goal, entry criterion, state on
  entry, exit criteria, proof of completion, implementation phases, and wave
  closure phase — lives in the matching per-wave file. The index and the
  per-wave files are jointly normative; if they disagree, the per-wave file is
  authoritative for wave-local detail and the index is authoritative for wave
  ordering and cross-cutting constraints. References to "the implementation
  plan" in other docs resolve to `implementation-plan.md` as the entry point.

The project does not use free-form status documents as normative inputs. The
core docs above, together with the reference and implementation trees, remain
the source of truth.

## 12. CI and workflows

CI configuration lives under `.ci/`.

Expected content:

- workflow definitions
- helper scripts
- reproducibility checks

CI must exercise the same invariants the local workflow expects:

- build
- test
- docs validation
- reproducibility or determinism gates when available
- `STUBS.md` consistency check: every stub in the table emits its declared
  diagnostic; the table contains no stubs that no longer exist in the code
- e2e proof program suite: all programs in `tests/e2e/` compile, run, and
  produce the expected output recorded in `tests/e2e/README.md`

CI failure on the `STUBS.md` consistency check or the e2e proof program suite
is a release blocker. These checks are not optional.

## 13. Unsafe bridge file list

Unsafe Fuse files that bridge to the runtime must be enumerated explicitly by
name.

At minimum, the core runtime bridge surface is expected to include files such
as:

- `stdlib/core/rt_bridge/alloc.fuse`
- `stdlib/core/rt_bridge/panic.fuse`
- `stdlib/core/rt_bridge/intrinsics.fuse`

If additional unsafe bridge files are required, this section and the rules
document must both be updated.

## 14. Adding a new top-level directory

New top-level directories are not created casually.

Required procedure:

1. Explain why no existing top-level directory is appropriate.
2. Update this document with the new directory and its intended purpose.
3. Update the implementation plan if the new directory changes the build or
   execution model.
4. Get explicit review before landing the change.

The default assumption is that the existing top-level tree is sufficient.
